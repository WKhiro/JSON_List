# JSON List

This was a short project made in about 2 hours. This simple web application connects to this [JSON data](https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json) and then fetches and sorts the data according to listId, and then name. Names that are blank or null are omitted. Since the data is sorted by "name" and not "id", this would be an example of correct ordering (ascending): "101", "2", "500", "67".
